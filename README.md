### Hi! Welcome to my project about StockX. 
### I'll walk you through my process of exploring Stock's database and ER diagram structure and using SQL to query and solve business problems.

#### For those unfamilar with StockX, it is an online marketplace that mimics the stock market, except it sells luxury or limited edition sneakers, accessories, apparel, electronics, and more.
#### There is full transparency on ask prices, bid prices, and ask prices. There are even convenient visualizations on price history as well as your typical stock market data including:
* 12-month trade range
* all-time trade range
* price premium (%)
* volatility
* number of sales
* average sale price


## Let's dive right in!
