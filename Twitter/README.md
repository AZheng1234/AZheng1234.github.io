## <ins> Introduction and Purpose of Project </ins>

I first came across the idea for this project in my Business Analytics course back in 2021. Although I did well on that project, I had barely scratched the surface when it came to the analytical techniques I could have used. So, when I had a chance to revisit it in my special topics course, Business Analytics II, I refined many of the ideas and took the analysis much further.

I recently became extremely interested in investing and the results of this project could help noob investors like me that don't want to blindly follow random advice.

### Question to answer: Can Elon Musk's Tweets predict TSLA stock prices?

### Business case:
* Semi-strong market efficiency: stock prices reflect all historical data and all public data
* Anatomy of a Tweet
* Tweet content ---> news and potential insider info?
* Likes, replies, retweets ---> reaction of the market
* This could potentially be a great tool for investors
